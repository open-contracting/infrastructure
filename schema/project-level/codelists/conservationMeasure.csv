Code,Title,Description
locationAnalysis,Location analysis,Location analysis was performed to select the site with the minimum potentially negative ecological impacts as a result of the project.
biologicalCorridors,Biological corridors,"Areas of habitat connecting wildlife populations, or different habitat types necessary for species lifecycles, separated by human activities or structures. Also known as wildlife or green corridors."
natureBasedSolutions,Nature based solutions,"Measures that use solutions already found in nature, for example conserving mangrove forests to protect homes against storm damage."
habitatRestoration,Habitat restoration,"The restoration of ecosystems negatively impacted by human activities, both historically and as a direct result of the project."
setAsides,Set-asides,Identification of areas within the project boundaries that are excluded from development and targeted for conservation enhancement measures.
invasiveSpeciesManagement,Invasive species management,"Measures taken to prevent the introduction of alien, invasive or non-native species, and combat the presence of such species identified within the project boundaries."
habitatLossReduction,Habitat loss reduction,Measures that reduce the ecological habitats lost as a direct result of the project.
pollutionReduction,Pollution reduction,"Measures that reduce the level of pollution generated as a direct result of the project. Pollution can include leakage into water courses or soil as well as noise, light, aerosol and gaseous emissions or vibrational nuisance to nearby wildlife populations."
soilManagement,Soil management,Measures that integrate sustainable soil management practices according to the Food and Agriculture Organization's Charter and Sustainable Soil Management Criteria.
biodiversityOffsets,Biodiversity offsets,"Measurable outcomes as a result of actions designed to compensate for adverse biological impacts due to the project that persist after avoidance, minimization and restoration measures have been taken."
