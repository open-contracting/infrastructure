# Guidance for data users

Publishing OC4IDS involves making choices including what data, projects and documents are included and/or excluded, and how to classify and categorize different items.

It's important for publishers to provide guidance alongside the data to help data users to understand these disclosure choices. The guidance should provide contextual information that supports users to interpret the data. Publishsers should also provide details on how users can feed back questions and suggestions for data improvements.

Publishers should add a link to their data use guidance in the project package `publicationPolicy` field.

For more information, please refer to the [OCDS publication policy guidance](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/implementation/publication_policy/) and the [OCDS publication policy template](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/ocds-1-1-publication-policy-template/).
