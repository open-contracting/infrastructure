# Data user guide

Publishing OC4IDS involves making choices about what projects, data and documents to include and/or exclude, and how to map existing data elements to the fields in OC4IDS.

In order for users to interpret data correctly and make effective use of it, it's important for publishers to describe these local decisions and to provide guidance to data users that includes:

* the purpose of publication
* how the data is generated
* the data's scope and format
* how the data can be reused
* how the publisher can be contacted

Publishers ought to link to this data user guide from the project package's `publicationPolicy` field.

For more information, please refer to the [OCDS publication policy guidance](https://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/implementation/publication_policy/). For assistance in drafting a data user guide, please refer to the [OCDS publication policy template](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/ocds-1-1-publication-policy-template/).
