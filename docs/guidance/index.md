# Implementation guidance

We are developing a package of guidance with details of how you can use the Open Contracting Data Standard, and CoST Project-Level Data Specification to collate and analyse information on infrastructure projects.

*  [Evaluating disclosures against the Infrastructure Data Standard](assess-against-ids.md)
* [Using open contracting data to understand infrastructure projects](contracts-to-projects.md)
* [Publishing data from an infrastructure transparency portal](publishing-from-portal.md)

We have also prepared some [example data](example.md).

```eval_rst

   :hidden:
