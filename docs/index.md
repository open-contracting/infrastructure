# Open Contracting for Infrastructure

The Open Contracting Data Standard is already used to describe millions of procurement processes around the world relating to goods, services and public works. 

This site describes how to combine **contract level disclosures using OCDS** with **project level disclosure**, in order to support scalable monitoring of infrastructure project design, delivery and impact. 

Trillions of dollars are spent every year on infrastructure, and estimates suggest between 10 and 30% of infrastructure investment is lost through inefficiency, mismanagement and corruption. Access to better and more joined up data is essential to drive better quality, more affordable infrastructure for government, citizens and business.

This Open Contracting for Infrastructure site will show you how to:

* Publish standardised contracting data for major infrastructure projects using the **open contracting data standard (OCDS)**;

* Extract infrastructure contracting data from existing procurement portals;

* Connect contract and project level information using the [project level schema](project/index.md).

* Assess published data against the [CoST Infrastructure Data Standard](project/mapping.md);

* Make use of data in infrastructure monitoring.
