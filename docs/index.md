# Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standards Toolkit

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is already used to describe millions of procurement processes around the world relating to goods, services and public works. The CoST Infrastructure Data Standard (CoST IDS) has been used to guide what data and information should be disclosed at each stage of the project cycle on over 25,000 infrastructure projects.

This site describes how to combine **contract level disclosures using OCDS** with **project-level disclosure based on the CoST IDS**, in order to support scalable disclosure and monitoring of infrastructure project identification, preparation, implementation and delivery.

Trillions of dollars are spent every year on infrastructure and estimates suggest between 10 and 30% of infrastructure investment is lost through inefficiency, mismanagement and corruption. Access to better and more joined up data is essential to drive better quality, more affordable and more accessible infrastructure for government, citizens and business.

This Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standards (OC4IDS) Toolkit will show you how to:

* [Publish standardised data](guidance/publishing.md) on infrastructure projects and contracts using the CoST IDS and OCDS.

* Extract [infrastructure contracting data from existing procurement portals](guidance/using.md).

* Connect contract and project-level information [using OC4IDS](projects/index.md).

* Assess published data [against the CoST IDS](guidance/evaluating.md).

* Make use of data when monitoring infrastructure projects.
