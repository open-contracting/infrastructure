## Packaging data

OC4IDS data must be published in a project package which acts an envelope for the data and contains important metadata.

The project package schema describes the container document for publishing data using the OC4IDS project level schema.

You can view an interactive version of the release schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../../../project-package-schema.json).

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section.
