## Packaging data

OC4IDS data must be published as part of project package, which acts as a container for data on multiple projects and adds important metadata about the publication. The project package schema describes this container.

You can view an interactive version of the project package schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download it here](../../project-package-schema.json).

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section.
