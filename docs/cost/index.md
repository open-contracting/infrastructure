# CoST - Infrastructure Transparency Initiative


CoST â€“ the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative (CoST) is the leading global initiative improving transparency and accountability in public infrastructure.

The [CoST approach](http://infrastructuretransparency.org/our-approach/) is based on four core features:

* **Disclosure** - where procuring entities are asked to follow the CoST Infrastructure Data Standard. This describes 40 items of data that should be disclosed at key stages of an infrastructure project cycle.

* **Assurance** -  an independent review of the disclosed data by assurance teams based within CoST national programmes. Teams may identify key issues of concern from the data that has been disclosed, and will put technical terms into plain language to allow stakeholders to understand the issues, and hold decision makers to account. 

* **Multi-stakeholder working** - each CoST national programme is managed by stakeholder group including government, private sector and civil society.

* **Social accountability** - raising awareness of key issues arising from the assurance process, and engaging civil society and media to hold decision makers to account. 

The 'Infrastructure Data Standard' is a **framework for disclosure** which has been adapted by a range of CoST national programmes, who have variously prioritised different elements based on their local needs, or who have included additional elements that they wish to monitor: particularly additional kinds of documentation that should be provided for each infrastructure project.

You can read more about the Infrastructure Data Standard in [CoST Guidance Note 6](http://infrastructuretransparency.org/resource/guidance-note-6-designing-a-disclosure-process/).

        There is an important distinction between the Infrastructure Data Standard (IDS) and the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). The former provides a framework identify *categories of information* that should be disclosed. The later describe *specific fields* and how they should be structured as data. 

        The Project Level Data Specification on this site acts as a bridge between the IDS framework, and the idea of a more structured technical data standard.

## Mapping against the IDS 

We have prepared a set of mapping tables that show how the items of data described by CoST can be represented using the Project Level Data Specification, and how many contracting level data items can be derived from Open Contracting Data Standard data.
