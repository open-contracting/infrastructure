# Support

If you are planning to publish or use data using the OC4IDS then the OC4IDS Helpdesk team are on hand to offer advice and input.

We can:

* Help you identify approaches for converting data from your existing systems to OC4IDS;
* Suggest existing tools and services which may help you publish or use OC4IDS data;
* Provide guidance on mapping your data structures to the standard;
* Give you feedback on draft data files, and support with validation of your data;

Through funding from the Open Contracting Partnership and CoST - the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative, this support is provided free of charge.

E-mail [data@open-contracting.org](mailto:data@open-contracting.org) with your questions, and a member of the OC4IDS Helpdesk will be in touch with you soon.
